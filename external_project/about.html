            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Lil Sweet Bakery is a bakery in Katy, Texas that sells gluten free, dairy free, and allergen friendly desserts! Lil Sweet Bakery wants to provide everyone with delicious food to treat themselves!</p>
            <p>Lil Sweet Bakery makes sure that all of our indivdually sold treats are at a reasonable price. Everything made at Lil Sweet Bakery is gluten free, dairy free, nut free, and soy free. Some are egg free as well.</p>
            <p>We started because our owner, Lillian Pantermuehl, like to bake and has food intolerances. She loves to bake for friends and family. Lillian found that gluten free and dairy free foods were becoming more common, but they were more costly and harder to find. That's when her commitment to a low cost, allergen friendly bakery came to life!</p><!--Lillian is my sister. This is what she wants to do once she graduates high school.-->
